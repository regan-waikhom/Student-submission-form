# Assignment Submission Webpage

This project is a simple web application that allows students to submit their assignment reports online. The submitted data, including the student's name, roll number, course, and uploaded assignment file, is processed and can be linked to a Google Sheet for easy management.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to work on various screen sizes.
- **File Upload**: Students can upload their assignments in PDF or DOCX format.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Basic form validation using JavaScript to ensure that all fields are filled out and a file is uploaded.
